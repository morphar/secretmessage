# [secretmessage.io](https://secretmessage.io/) BETA

Secret Message is an attempt to create a secure and easy way to share passwords and other sensitive information, without having to e.g. use a shared password manager.

This repo contains all of the code used on the website [Secret Message](https://secretmessage.io/).

The technical details of the implementation will be documented on the website.

## Security

I have tried to keep things simple, conventional, standard and "boring".  
I haven't invented anything new, but utilized the common standards and the browers' crypto library [SubtleCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto).  
Everything is handled in the browser, nothing is sent to a server or third party.
