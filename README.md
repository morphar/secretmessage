# [secretmessage.io](https://secretmessage.io/) BETA

Secret Message is an attempt to create a secure and easy way to share passwords and other sensitive information, without having to e.g. use a shared password manager.

This repo contains all of the code used on the website [Secret Message](https://secretmessage.io/).

The technical details of the implementation will be documented on the website.

## Bugs

## Security

I have tried to keep things simple, conventional, standard and "boring".  
I haven't invented anything new, but utilized the common standards and the browers' crypto library [SubtleCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto).  
Everything is handled in the browser, nothing is sent to a server or third party.

## Security Audit

Secret Message has not been security audited officially or unonficially, yet.  
The source code is open and can be scrutinized by anybody.  
You're also free to copy the code and create your own copy.  
If you want to audit Secret Message or know anybody who want to do it for free, please do contact me.
